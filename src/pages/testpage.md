# How to Make a Cake

1. Gather the ingredients:
    - 2 cups all-purpose flour
    - 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
    - 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
    - 1 cup milk
    - 3 large eggs
    - 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
    - 2 teaspoons baking powder
    - 1/2 teaspoon salt

2. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).

3. In a large mixing bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy.

4. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.

5. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt.

6. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the milk. Begin and end with the dry ingredients, mixing well after each addition.

7. Pour the batter into a greased and floured cake pan.

8. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

9. Remove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely.

10. Once the cake is cooled, you can frost it with your favorite frosting and decorate as desired.

Enjoy your homemade cake!
