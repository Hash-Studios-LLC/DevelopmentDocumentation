# Introduction

Welcome to Hash Studios! We specialize in providing top-notch prefabs for VRChat world developers. Our prefabs come with specific requirements and setups, and this documentation is here to make your life easier by guiding you through each step.

<br />

### Getting Started

Get started by **[exploring our prefabs](/docs/category/udon/)** and reviewing the necessary setups.

<br />

### What you'll need

You'll need to install some requirements, which you can find in the **[project setup](/docs/general-concepts/settingupudon/)** section.

<br />

### Prefab Setup

To set up our prefabs, follow the **[detailed instructions](/docs/category/udon/)** provided in this documentation. Weâ€™ve put a lot of effort into making it comprehensive and helpful.

<br />

### General Concepts

While we strive to keep everything up to date, please note that we do not control all aspects of Unity or VRChat Creator Companion (VRCCC). Some information may become outdated, but you can always refer to the **[General Concepts](/docs/category/general-concepts/)** section for the basics of Unity.

<br />

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, first check the **[Troubleshooting](/docs/general-concepts/settingupudon/)** section for possible solutions. 

Also, look inside the current bug reports in our **[Discord server](https://discord.gg/78EnuECcY4)**. 

If that doesn't resolve your issue, please make a bug report in the Discord.
