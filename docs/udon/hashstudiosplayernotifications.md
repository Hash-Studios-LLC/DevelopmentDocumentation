In the `Advanced Settings` section, you can adjust advanced settings for the notification menu, such as whether it follows the player's head, scales with the avatar size, etc:

- `Follow Player Toggle` - This toggle decides whether the notification and particle effect will track the player's head movement. If disabled, they will simply appear in front of the player without following. You may choose to disable this feature if you think the notification could become bothersome.
- `Scale to Player Size` - This toggle determines whether the notification will adjust its size based on the player's size in the world. If your world does not permit player resizing, using this option is recommended.
- `Scale Distance Based on Size` - This toggle allows you to set the notification's distance based on the player's size, enhancing the notification experience but at the cost to optimization. If your world does not permit player resizing, using this option is recommended.
