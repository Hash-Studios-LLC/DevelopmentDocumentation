# Installing Hash Studios On-Off Toggle  

:::warning  
**Version:** This guide is for Unity 2022.3.22f1. The steps may be different in future versions of Unity.

The Hash Studios On-Off Toggle is a free and easy-to-use prefab that allows you to turn any collider into a functional button for toggling objects on and off. You can configure the toggle to be global (affecting all players) or local (only affecting the individual user).  

For more advanced users, the toggle also supports adding custom Udon program events, making it a versatile tool for triggering other scripts. Additionally, a button asset is included to complement the toggle visually.
