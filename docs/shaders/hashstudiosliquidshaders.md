</div>

If you have an older version of Hash Studios Liquid Shaders that does not support z3y, follow these steps:

1. Open the Shader Graph for the shader you want to fix.

2. In the Shader Graph Inspector, ensure your current target is set to `Built-In`.

3. Add an additional target by selecting `Built-In (z3y)`.

This process allows you to update your shaders to support z3y's Shader Graph package without losing existing functionality.

<br/><br/>

## Creating a New Shader with z3y's Shader Graph

If you want to create a new shader from scratch using z3y's Shader Graph:

1. In Unity, open Shader Graph and create a new shader.

2. Choose the `Built-In (z3y)` target. Do not choose the default Shader Graph target.

<br/><br/>

## Using z3y's Shader Graph Fork in Non-VRChat Projects (Optional)

1. If you want to use these shaders in a non-VRChat project, import the Unity Package from the releases section on the GitHub repository's Release section.

<br/><br/>

By following these steps, you can successfully install Hash Studios Liquid Shaders and enhance your virtual environment with stunning water and lava effects.
